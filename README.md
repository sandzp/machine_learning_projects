# Machine Learning Projects

## Supervised + Unsupervised learning using SciKitLearn.

### Project 1

**Digit recognition using the MNIST dataset and SciKitLearn**

1. Applying basic SKLearn libraries (Naive Bayes (incl. Gaussian Naive Bayes), Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors) to identify object classes. 
2. Functions to print grids of images.
3. Creating from scratch a bespoke image blurring function. 

### Project 2

**Basic natural language processing using altnet forum messages and SciKitLearn**

1. Applying basic SKLearn libraries (Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression) to text data for message category prediction. 
2. Basic text pre-processing using NLTK and Regex.
3. Creation of vocabularies for training machine learning models to predict message categories. 

### Project 3

**Unsupervised learning using SKLearn and the Kaggle Poisonous Mushrooms dataset**

1. Applying dimensionality reduction (principal component analysis) and basic unsupervised learning (Gaussian mixture models) to classify a highly dimensional dataset containing mushroom information to determine whether mushrooms are poisonous or non-poisonous. 
2. Optimizing Gaussian mixture models.
