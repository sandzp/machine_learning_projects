# ML Projects
Supervised + Unsupervised learning using SciKitLearn libraries.

## Project 1

**Digit recognition using the MNIST dataset and SciKitLearn**

1. Applying basic SKLearn libraries (Naive Bayes (incl. Gaussian Naive Bayes), Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors) to identify object classes. 
2. Functions to print grids of images.
3. Creating from scratch a bespoke image blurring function. 

**Basic natural language processing using altnet forum messages and SciKitLearn**

1. Applying basic SKLearn libraries (Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression) to text data for message category prediction. 
2. Basic text pre-processing using NLTK and Regex.
3. Creation of vocabularies for training machine learning models to predict message categories.
